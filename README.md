# AvaHash

AvaHash is a small and portable desktop app to calculate file hashes. It was created using [AvaloniaUI](https://www.avaloniaui.net/) and [communitytoolkit.MVVM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/mvvm/).

AvaHash was tested on Windows 11 and Linux, but should also work on MacOS.
